             <a href="" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Grilling is a form of cooking that involves dry heat applied to the surface of food, commonly from above, below or from the side. Grilling usually involves a significant amount of direct, radiant heat, and tends to be used for cooking meat and vegetables quickly. Food to be grilled is cooked on a grill (an open wire grid such as a gridiron with a heat source above or below), using a cast iron/frying pan, or a grill pan (similar to a frying pan, but with raised ridges to mimic the wires of an open grill).">

         A simple dry rub is enough to turn roast beef into a real crowd-pleaser. The slightly spicy meat is scrumptious the first and second time around, piled on top of fresh crusty bread. —Allison Ector, Ardmore, PennsylvaniaGrilling corn in the husks is so easy. There's no need to remove the silk and tie the husk closed before grilling. Just soak, grill and add your favorite flavored butter. —Taste of Home Test Kitchen, Milwaukee, Wisconsin

        Spicy aioli brings a zesty kick to steak tacos, and the ribeye is a nice upgrade from typical ground beef. Grab one and enjoy the burst of flavor in each bite! —Michael Compean, Los Angeles, California. I love the way these fresh flavors blend together. It's a snap to throw this together using leftover burgers for a quick, healthy lunch. The burgers can also be served on buns. —Rachelle McCalla, Batesville, Arkansas. I made these lively chicken kabobs as a thank-you gift while visiting my relatives in Norway They loved eating them almost as much as I loved cooking for them! If you prefer less heat in the chutney, you can use honey in place of pepper jelly. Also, any variety of vegetables will work with these. —Anna Davis, Springfield, Missouri. This is my go-to appetizer in the summer when tomatoes and basil are fresh from the garden. The balsamic glaze takes this bruschetta recipe over the top. I like to use a Tuscan Herb or basil-infused olive oil for this. But, it's great with just plain olive oil too. —Brittany Allyn, Mesa, Arizona. When my family thinks of summer grilling, it's ribs all the way. Our Asian-inspired recipe is a welcome change from the usual barbecue-sauce versions. —Ginger Sullivan, Cutler Bay, Florida.

         The kicked-up marinade on these shrimp makes this a flavor-packed dish. Serve over rice, and make sure to squeeze those charred lemons over top—that makes them taste extra bright and delicious. —Sharon Delaney-Chronis, South Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This is one of the most fantastic, flavorful burgers I've ever made. Ranch is a favorite in dips and dressings, and believe me, it doesn't disappoint in these burgers, either! —Kari Shifflett, Lake Mills, Iowa. My husband and I entertain a lot in summer, and this has quickly become the most-requested dish. I usually serve it with Mexican rice and a tossed salad. I had never tried grilling lobster tails at home until I tried this convenient and deliciously different recipe. It turned out amazing, and has left me with little reason to ever order grilled lobster tail at a restaurant again.

         Get ready to experience another side of stone fruits. Hot off the rack, these grilled nectarines practically melt in your mouth. Just a few minutes and a handful of ingredients are all you’ll need for this scrumptious side dish. Hoisin sauce and rice wine vinegar give grilled pattypans Asian flair. The combination of pork and cherries has long been a favorite of mine. The hint of spice and chocolate in the salsa mole makes the combination even more special. —Roxanne Chan, Albany, CaliforniaThe combination of pork and cherries has long been a favorite of mine. The hint of spice and chocolate in the salsa mole makes the combination even more special.

         I came up with this recipe one summer as a way to use up vegetables from our garden. Grilling the veggies first brings out their sizzling flavors. Try it with a sprinkling of olives or pine nuts before adding the cheese. Chimichurri is a very popular condiment in Argentina and Uruguay and is most often used as a dipping sauce or a marinade for meats. My chimichurri shrimp version incorporates dill and lime, which give it a brighter flavor, making it ideal for spring and summer entertaining. The spicy heat of the chicken pairs beautifully with the flavorful cilantro butter in this original recipe from Diane Halferty of Corpus Christi, Texas. We added spicy chocolate cinnamon cane sugar to the chicken, which complemented the other spices that are brushed over the chicken before grilling. This is grilled butternut squash recipe is one of my favorite ways to cook with fresh produce. I usually make it when I am grilling steak or chicken.

         Skewers with seasoned steak, bread and veggies are grilled and topped with provolone cheese for a fantastic meal. Coleslaw, spruced up with chopped walnuts, is a great side for the kabobs. Relax after work with a cold drink while this savory chicken marinates in an herby tomato blend for an hour, then toss it on the grill. It tastes just like summer. One night I goofed, accidentally using the balsamic butter I save for grilling chicken on my pound cake. What a delicious mistake that my entire family loved! For a patriotic look, add a drizzle of blueberry syrup. I created this recipe for my family because they love grilled shrimp. I love it because it's quick, delicious and good for us.

        I got this grilled chicken recipe from a friend while living in Hawaii. It sizzles with the flavors of brown sugar, ginger and soy sauce. Huli means "turn" in Hawaiian. This sweet and savory glaze is fantastic on pork chops, too. Teens like assembling these creative kabobs almost as much as they like devouring them. The whole family is sure to love the sensational Southwestern flavor of this twist on beef shish kabobs. We live in the hot South, and this awesome fruity chicken salad is a weeknight standout. I buy salad greens and add veggies for color and crunch. My Nigerian brother-in-law introduced me to beef suya, a very spicy street food that's popular in western Africa. I was intrigued when I found out the spice rub is made from ground peanuts and a blend of different seasonings. After lots of experimenting, I came up with my own version.       </p>

         The best of summer in one dish! This pretty grilled vegetable recipe is meant for entertaining. Grilling brings out their natural sweetness, and the easy marinade really kicks up the grilled vegetables' flavor. Roasting fresh-picked corn is as old as the Ozark hills where I was raised. My Grandpa Mitchell always salted and peppered his butter on the edge of his plate before spreading it on his corn, and I did the same as a kid. Today, I continue the tradition by serving lemon-pepper butter with roasted corn—it's a favorite! A friend who's an excellent cook shared this hamburger recipe with me, and it has since become a family favorite. The unusual combination of cola and French salad dressing added to the ground beef gives it fabulous flavor. The mixture is also used as a basting sauce on the moist burgers.    </p>

        One summer my mother-in-law made us grilled peaches basted with a sweet and tangy sauce. These are so good I'm always tempted to eat the whole batch. Friends shared this three-ingredient marinade years ago, and it’s been a favorite since. Serve this steak with salad and grilled potatoes for a quick meal.    </p>
